# ESG vs Financial Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview
This Tableau dashboard explores how ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores correlate with financial performance across industries and regions over time. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations covering ESG vs. financial metrics by industry, ESG score trends over time, and ESG scores by region compared to carbon emissions.

## Insights & Observations

- High ESG scores don't always guarantee financial outperformance, but some industries (e.g., tech and healthcare) show a strong positive relationship.

- ESG scores have generally improved in developed regions, while emerging markets show inconsistent progress.

- Some regions with high ESG ratings still show elevated carbon emissions, indicating potential greenwashing or data misalignment.
