# ESG vs Financial Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview
This Tableau dashboard explores how ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores correlate with financial performance across industries and regions over time. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations covering ESG vs. financial metrics by industry, ESG score trends over time, and ESG scores by region compared to carbon emissions.

## Key Insights

### 1. ESG Scores vs. Financial Metrics by Industry
- Visualizes how ESG scores align (or diverge) from financial performance indicators like revenue growth, ROI, and net income across sectors.

---

### 2. ESG Trends by Year and Region
- Shows changes in ESG scores by industry and/or region, allowing users to identify long-term trends and assess progress over time.

---

### 3. ESG Scores and Carbon Emissions by Region
- Compares ESG performance at a regional level with actual environmental impact metrics, revealing discrepancies or alignments between ESG scores and emission outputs.

## Insights & Observations

- High ESG scores don't always guarantee financial outperformance, but some industries (e.g., tech and healthcare) show a strong positive relationship.

- ESG scores have generally improved in developed regions, while emerging markets show inconsistent progress.

- Some regions with high ESG ratings still show elevated carbon emissions, indicating potential greenwashing or data misalignment.

## Additional Notes

This was my second attempt at a Tableau dashboard, and my 3rd dashboard overall. 

I am constantly relying on Google and ChatGPT for assistance, but I am learning.

I chose to analyze financial data this time because I think that is what I would primarily be analyzing for a business. I created 3 different charts on 3 sheets, then combined them into a dashboard and added text and background color this time.

This allowed me to see the layout view, and how floating boxes can be moved and re-sized for your visualization.

There isn't much continuity in this analysis. I wanted to pull data with relevant queries and then try to display it in a pleasant way.

I have a lot of work to do on cleaning, querying, and displaying the data, but I'm progressing.
